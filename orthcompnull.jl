R = orthcompnull(A, X)
Project each column of X onto the orthogonal complement of the null space of the input matrix A .
In:
* A MÃ—N matrix
* X vector of length N , or matrix with N rows and many columns
Out:
*  R  : vector or matrix of size ??? (you determine this)
For full credit, your solution should be computationally efficient!
